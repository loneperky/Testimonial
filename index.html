          I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. i have 
          been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
          had an amazing experience here. i signed up for the free intro mid-course
          and found it incredibly fun! i enrolled thereafter. the next 12 weeks 
          were the best-and most grueling-time of my life. since the course, i have 
          sucessfully change careers, working as software engineer at a VAR setup.

        <p class="kiratalk">Before joining the bootcamp i have nerver written aline of code
          i needed some structures from professional who can help me learn peogramming 
          step by step. i was encouraged to enroll by a former student of thiers
          who can only say wonderful things about the program. the entire 
          curriculum and staff did not disappoint. they were very hands on and i never 
          had to wait long for assistance. the agile team project, in particular,
          was outstanding. it took  my learning to the next level in a way no tutorial 
          could ever had. infact i have often referred to it during interviews as an example 
          of my development experience. it certainly help me land a job as a full-
          stark developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend.
